# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

## Overview
This Java project shows the difference between arrays and arraylists. Arrays are fixed in size and work with primitive data types. Arraylists are dynamic and can grow or shrink. They only work with objects not primitives.

## Key Concepts
- **Arrays** are fixed size and good for simple data like int or double when you know the number of elements
- **ArrayLists** can grow and shrink and let you add or remove values easily

## How to Run
1. Open this project in any Java IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse  
2. Compile and run the `DifferenceArraysArrayLists.java` file  
3. View the output to see the difference between arrays and arraylists
